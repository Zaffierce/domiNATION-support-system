# TODO

* Trophy Request Form (Blooper's idea)
   - This will be the hardest because of how I want to do it, however it's implementation may provide to be fruitful to other ticket submissions (i.e. multiple dino requests)
* Implement API for Kakoen & Patreon website (Need to discuss further)
* Implement AJAX for notes section on a ticket
* Implement Error Handling & Reporting
* Look into better reporting process to Discord (meaning a cleaner message besides "A new ticket has been submitted!")
